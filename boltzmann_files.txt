The reaction file, recommended extension .dat but coud be .rxn
see tca.dat for example. It is read by parse_reactions_file.c

This file is a list of ASCI lines with information about the chemical reactions
to be simulated with statistical thermodynamics.
In the text below things in angle brackets, <> denote variable quanties
things in uppercase are Verbatim, lines refer to LF terminated lines (\n)
(linux style not MS style)

Each Reaction description starts with a title line:

REACTION <title_name>

and ends with a line containing only two forward slashes:

//

all other lines in the file must be between a REACTION title line and
its closing //

Each reaction must have a LEFT line and a RIGHT line that lists 
the chemical species involved in the reaction with the reactants on 
the "LEFT" line and the products on the RIGHT line.

The chemical species within a line must be separated by a white space surrounded plus sign. Each chemical species may be preceded by a stoichimetric 
coefficient (which is assumed to be 1 if it is absent) and a space or tab, 
and postfixed with a charge (no space between the charge and species names).
Because spaces are used as delimiters between stoichmetric coeffiecents and
the species separating plus signs - species chemical names may not contain
any white space and ion indications must immediately follow species designation with no intervening white space:

LEFT	D-RIBULOSE-1,5-BISPHOSPHATE + CO2 + H2O
RIGHT	2 3-PHOSPHO-D-GLYCERATE + 2 H+

Also a DGZERO line specifies the Gibbs free energy of formation if it is known
and the DGZERO-UNITS line specifies the units for DGZERO either KJ/MOL or 
KCAL/MOL.

A PATHWAY Line may be used to specify a PATHWAY name that the reaction is
part of
and a COMMENT line/lines may be used to add any documentation that
may be relevant to the reaction information. It is not actually used by
the boltzmann code.


Here is a simple reaction entry in a rxn.dat file.

REACTION 21, 62  RIBULOSE BISPHOSPHATE CARBOXYLASE
DGZERO	61.1	
DGZERO-UNITS	KJ/MOL
COMMENT from Dennis' calculations
PATHWAY	CALVIN CYCLE, RUBISCO SHUNT
//


Other possible lines describing a reaction are
COMPARTMENT  <compartment_name>
LEFT_COMPARTMENT <left_compartment_name>
RIGHT_COMPARTMENT <right_compartament_name>

Compartment names are optional, and if not specified the default 
global compartment is assumed.
The left and right compartment names allow for reactants to be in one
compartment and products to be in another, enabling the transfer of
species from one compartment to another.

Also available are
ACTIVITY
PREGULATION and
NREGULATION lines.

ACTIVITY lines are

ACTIVITY <floating_point_number_in_0_to_1>

and are not currently used - ask Bill Cannon about intended future use. 

PREGULATION lines are of the format:

PREGULATION <metabolite> <constant> <exponent>

NREGULATION lines have the same format replacing the P with N

Initial concentrations file:
Read by read_initial_concentrations.c

First line in an initial concentrations file must be a VOLUME line
specifying the default compartment volume 
What are the assumed units (liters)
Usual value is 1.e-15

Next a CONC_UNITS line is required this is a constant 
stored in state->conc_units
This value is a scaling applied to the input concentrations,
so if concs are Moles/ml, this would be 1.0e-3
if concs are Moles/l this would be 1.0, usually 1.0

Then one per line 

<species_name> <concentration> <variable_or_fixed> <compute_c> <e_val> <u_val>

where <variable_or_fixed> is the single letter V or F for whether this
species concentration is allowed to vary during the simulation or whether
it is fixed.

<compute_c> <e_val> and <uval> are optional and used in respect to 
kss stuff, and don't seem to be used any more. check with Bill on that.
