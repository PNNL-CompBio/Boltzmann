William Cannon <william.cannon@pnnl.gov> developed the
statistical thermodynamics concepts and
algorithms use in the boltzmann package, and generated the examples.

Douglas Baxter <douglas.baxter@pnnl.gov> is the lead programer and
developed most of the source code, including the adaptation of the
MATLAB ode23tb routine for an ode solver, and incorporation of the
SUNDIALS cvodes package.

David Brown <david.brown@pnnl.gov>
  provided the autoconf pieces

Dennis Thomas <dennis.thomas@pnnl.gov> provided pseudoisomer data file
and some code modifications usually denoted by a comment containing
"DGT". The pseudoisomer data was downloaded from
http://equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il.

We use a derivative of the matlab ode23tb for one of our ode solvers.

The SUNDIALS package from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory by
A.C. Nidmarsh and R. Serban provied an alternate ode solver for the
boltzmann code.
