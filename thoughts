*.dat is the input file.

LEFT    <reactant> [ + <reactant>]

DGZERO  <float>
DGZERO-UNITS kJ/mol or kCal/mole
//

reactant = product = \d+ a..Z[_a..Z0..9+-]


need a sorted list of reactants and products
sorted how, for fast look up?
build a dictionary.

use an fgrep for // to count reactions
use an inquire or  wc to get the file size.


need to be able to uppercase a string.

First just read, align and store all of them with
lengths in corresponding length array.

Read in one giant array, count number of \n// occurences
multiply by 2, count number of "\s + \s" occurences, and add these
together for max possible reactants and products.

Ask Bill about continuation lines, just assume for now there aren't any.
