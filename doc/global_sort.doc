So the notion is I have a set of sorted molecules istrings for each
reaction file, and those point to compartment strings, also sorted for each
file.

What I need then is a global table of compartments and molecule strings and
mappings for each reaction file.

So I need a merge compartments routine first to merge and map compartments,
and then a merge molecules routine to merge and map molecules.
We will use the lookup routines for that 

when I call boltzmann_init, I get back a pointer to a block of memory that
is the state structure. I want to preserve that state structure and 
extract first the unique compartments, then the unique molecules.
each compartment/molecule has the notion of a reaction file number and then
corresponding compartment/molecule position within that file.

so first we need to build a compartment map. 
 need partial sums of unique_compartments values
 need partial sums of unique_molecules values.

   reaction_file_number, reaction_file_pos, compartment_string_pointer
	                                    or molecules_string_pointer and
   global_compartment_index.

    need to know how much space for the strings, this could be computed
	in unique_compartments and unique_molecules routines.
	sum of strlen's + unique_compartments*align_len;
	the fields containing the sum of the strlens will be 
	sum_molecule_len and sum_compartment_len.


Notion of global number of compartments, global number of molecules,
pointers to each, and a buffer of enough space to store them all.
