So regulation is a way to specify activities.
We will add fields to the rxn_struct p_reg_constant and p_reg_exp,
n_reg_constant and n_reg_exp

where the activity for a reacion is then

   p_act = s_1^p_reg_exp/(p_reg_const + s_1^p_reg_exp)

   n_act = n_reg_constant/n_reg_const + s_2^n_reg_exp) 


   if p_reg_exp is 0 and p_reg_const is 0 we have activity of 1.
   if n_reg_const 0 and n_reg_exp is 0 we have activity of 0.

  where s_1 and s_2 are the relevant species, now s_1 and s_2
need to be specified by species number, to start with though we will only 
have the names, but just as we look up the names for the left and right species,
so we will look up the names of the regulation species.

   Talking with Bill if we have both p_act and n_act the we should use as
   activity sqrt(p_act * n_act).

   so we need to track if PREGULATION and/or NREGULATION are specified.
   For now we will leave the ability to explicitly specify activity,
   with the activity line, but we will modify that if

May have more than one/2 regulators, Bill says not more than 4.

So we need a notion number of regulators, and a max_num_regulators,

   for each regulator we need a species, a constant, and an exponent, and a direction (positive or negative).

   If we have more than one regulator for a reaction we will use the product for the activity for now, at some point we might decide to use the nth root of the product where n is the number of regulators
