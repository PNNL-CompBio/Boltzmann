<tr>
<td>
<b>OUT_DIR</b>
</td>
<td>
Path prefix for output files. This path should already exist before running boltzmann as boltzmann makes no
effort to create the directories. Default is "."
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>
<b>OUT_FILE</b>
</td>
<td>
Filename base used to set output file names if they are not explicitly specified in one of the parameters below.
If this file has a suffix, it is replaced by the default suffix for a particular output file when generating 
the default name for output files not explicitly given. If it doesn't have a suffix, then the the whole name
is used as the filename base when generating default output file names.

<tr>
<td>
<b>LOG_FILE</b>
</td>
<td>
Filename for the log file that boltzmann writes warning, error, and informational messages to, and echoes
its parameters to. Default suffix is ".log"
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<b>RXN_ECHO_FILE</b>
</td>
<td>
Filename for the file that echoes the reactions in the RXN_FILE.
Default suffix is ".echo"
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<b>RXN_MAT_FILE</b>
</td>
<td>
Filename for the file that the has reaction matrix printed.
Default suffix is ".mat"
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<b>DICTIONARY_FILE</b>
</td>
<td>
Filename for the file that the species in the RXN_FILE are echoed to in
sorted order, so as to attach the numbering that boltzmann uses to the
species name. Default suffix is ".dict"

<td>
<b>COUNTS_OUT_FILE</b>
</td>
<td>
File name for printing out species counts during record loop. Default suffix is ".count"

<b>FREE_ENERGY_FILE</b>
</td>
<td>
File name for printing reaction free energy per reaction. Default suffix is ".fe"
Only active if the free_energy_format parameter is 1,2,or 3.

<td>
<b>DG0KE_FILE</b>
</td>
<td>
File name for printing delta_g0 and equilibrium constants for each reaction. Default suffix is ".dg0ke"
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<b>RXN_VIEW_FILE</b>
</td>
<td>
File name for reaction for printing the transpose of the
matrix in the reaction likelihood file. 
With likelihoods for each timestep  for a reaction printed accross one row.

<td>
File name for printing the flux of the fixed concentration species in the reaction. Default suffix is ".flux"

file. Default suffix is ".rstrt"
