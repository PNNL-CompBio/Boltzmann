Boltzmann is a library of ANSI standard C procedures and a few executables designed to
allow the statistical thermodynamics simulation of a set of chemical reactions
in a collection of compartments. 
</p>
<p>
The boltzmann program simulaties the system of reactions statistically, 
determining the likelihood that reactions will fire based on thermodymanmics, 
and species concentrations, and chooses randomly weighted by the likelihoods,
which reactions to "fire" to change concentrations and progress the overall
system. The main simulation of boltzmann is divided into a warm up loop,
where observations of concentrations at intermediate time steps are not recorded
and a record loop where concentrations, their derivitiaves, reaction likelihoods
and other quantites may be recorded in various output files at regular
intervals. The warm-up loop is used to allow the system to reach a steady
state (not necessarily equilibrium) before starting to record. Depending
on how close the initial concentrations are to the steady state concentrations
the user might find very many warm upsteps are needed before steady state is
achieved. Thus we have added the ability to simulate the reactions via
solving the Intial Value Problem of ordinary differential equations (ODE's)
specified by the chemistry of the reactions in the reactions file.
</p>
Input to Boltzmann is comprised of three main input files, and an auxilliary input file, <b> pseudoisomer_dg0f.txt</b>, that the user will not change often if ever.
The three main input files are the parameters file (.in), the initial concentrations file (_concs.in) and the
reactions file (.dat). The parameters file is specified as the first and only argument to boltzmann on the command line.
It in turn defines the names for the intial concentrations file and the reactions file.

<h2> Usage </h2> 
<p>
Boltzman is invoked from the command line with a single argument, the name of
the parameters input file.
