Fundamental rate change equation.

dS_m/dt =  sum      g_(i,m)*(K_f(i)* rt[i] - K_r(i) * pt[i])
          rxns i                     
	  that                       
	  m is 
	  in  


      S_m is the concentration of species m. g_(i,m) is the stoicheometric coefficient of species m in reaction i.

      where pt[i] = product     S_k^g(i,k)
		    k a product	    
		    in rxn i          


            rt[i] = product         S_j^g_(i,j)
	            j a reactant
		    in rxn i.

            K_f(i) and K_r(i) are the forward and reverse rate constants for reaction i.
	    Ke[i] represesents the equilibrium constant for reaction i,
	    rKe[i] representst the equilibrium constat for the reverse of reaction i.
            B is the base reaction,
            and Q[i] is the reation quotient pt[i]/rt[i]


	    L_f[i] = forward likelihood  = Ke[i] * Q[i]^-1

            L_r(i] = reverse likelihood  = rKe[i] * Q[i];

		    
Different Lr* approximate K_f(i) and K_r(i) differently.


Lr1 

    K_f[i] = Ke[i]/(pt[i]*Ke[B]*Q[B]^-1)



   and K_r[i] = 1.0/(pt(i) * Ke(B)*Q[B]^-1) 


Lr2

   K_f[i] = L_f[i]/(L_f[B] * rt[i]) 

   K_r[i] = L_r[i]/pt[i]


Lr3     

     K_f[i] = L_f[i]/(L_f[B] * rt[i]) 

     K_r[i] = L_f[i]*L_r[i]/(L_f[B]*pt[i])


Lr4
    
     K_f[i] = L_f[i]/(L_f[b] * rt[i]) 

     K_r[i] = L_r[i]/(L_f[B] * pt[i])



lr5

    K_f[i] = L_f[i]/(L_t * rt[i])

    K_r[i] = L_r[i]/(L_t * pt[i])

    where L_t = sum L_f[i] + sum L_r[i]
                 i            i


Lr6 (computational alchemy) 


           K_f[i] = exp (sum (g_(i,j) Dg0[j])/(-RT))
                         g_(i,j) > 0


           K_r[i] = exp (sum (g_(i,j) Dg0[j])/(-RT))
                         g_(i,j) < 0



Lr7

	   K_f[i] = Ke[i]/tp[i];

	   K_r[i] = rKE[i]/tr[i];


      where tp[i] = product     (S_k+g_(i,k))^g_(i,k)
		    k a product	    
		    in rxn i          


            tr[i] = product     (S_j+g_(i,j))^g_(i,j)
	            j a reactant
		    in rxn i.
	   
           but tp and tr computed with concs (so g_(i,j) in the addidtive term is scaled by 1/(avo*volume).


Lr8 
      Same as lr 7 but tp and tr are computed with counts instead of concs.


Lr9 uses read in rate constants, for K_f and K_r expecting concentration based rate constants.

Lr10 uses read in rate constants, for K_f and K_r expecting conunt based rate constants.


Lr11, stable addition flavor of lr8.

Lr12, stable addition flavor of lr10.

Lr13, d n_i/dt = 1/log(n_i/exp(-molecule_dg0tfs[i]/RT)) sum K_j *  Q_j^-1
                                                         j

lr14 sames as lr7 but tp and tr replaced by pt and rt.
